To make hangman game:

- first need to make array of several words that the computer will randomly pick
- computer will tell player how many characters are in the word it picked
- will need to have user input a guess
- computer will check if any of the letters appear in the word that was picked
    - if any letters, computer will have to say which letter and how many instances of it appear
    - if none, then computer will prompt user to guess again
- after user's guess, computer will tell user how many guesses they have left
- once last guess is used, if it is wrong, tell user what the word was and say sorry you lost
- if guess matches the word, break the loop and tell user they won

We need:
- random bank of words
- guesses allowed (8)


After having the computer randomly select a word:
1. it tells us how many letters are in the word
2. now, it should ask user for input 

For Each character in the guessed word as [], (maybe use String.split()),
 or alternatively, For index in String.length, check if the character exists
 inside the random word (Maybe use a function like String.includes())
